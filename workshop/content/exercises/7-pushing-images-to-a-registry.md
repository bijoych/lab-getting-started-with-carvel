The previous section showed how to use kbld with local cluster that's backed by local Docker daemon. No remote registry was involved; however, for a production environment or in absence of a local environment, you will need to instruct kbld to push out built images to a registry accessible to your cluster. This is our case and we will finally see our application change.

`config-step-4-build-local/build.yml` specifies that `quay.io/eduk8s-labs/sample-app-go` should be pushed to a repository as specified by `push_images_repo` data value.

Our local docker client is already authenticated to the registry we will be pushing to, but otherwise you would need to make sure that it can push to it.

Also, to prepare for the deployment there is a secret that we need to apply once, so that Kubernetes can pull images from the private repo we have been using:

```execute-1
kubectl create secret generic registry-credentials --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=$HOME/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Now 

```execute-1
ytt template -f config-step-4-build-and-push/ -v hello_msg="k14s user" -v push_images=true -v push_images_repo={{ REGISTRY_HOST }}/k14s/sample-app-go | kbld -f- | kapp deploy -a simple-app -f- --diff-changes --yes
```

```

As a benefit of using kbld, you will see that image digest reference (e.g. index.docker.io/your-username/your-repo@sha256:4c8b96...) was used instead of a tagged reference (e.g. kbld:docker-io...). Digest references are preferred to other image reference forms as they are immutable, hence provide a gurantee that exact version of built software will be deployed.
