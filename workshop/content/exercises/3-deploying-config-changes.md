Let's make a change to the application configuration to simulate a common occurrence in a development workflow. A simple observable change we can make is to change the value of the `HELLO_MSG` environment variable in `config-step-1-minimal/config.yml`

```
         - name: HELLO_MSG
-          value: stranger
+          value: somebody
```

Go ahead and make this change in the embedded editor or using `vi` as you prefer. Once you've changed this file re-run kapp deploy:

```
kapp deploy -a simple-app -f config-step-1-minimal/ --diff-changes
```

You should see a similar output to these:

```

Above output highlights several kapp features:

* kapp detected a single change to `simple-app` Deployment by comparing given local configuration against the live cluster copy
* kapp showed changes in a git-style diff via --diff-changes flag
* since `simple-app` Service was not changed in any way, it was not "touched" during the apply changes phase at all
* kapp waited for Pods associated with a Deployment to converge to their ready state before exiting successfully

To double check that our change applied, go ahead and hit the service url again in the terminal.

```execute-2
curl http://simple-app.{{ session_namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

Given that kapp does not care where application configuration comes from, one can use it with any other tools that produce k8s configuration, for example, Helm's template command:

```
helm template my-chart --values values.yml | kapp deploy -a my-app -f- --yes
```
